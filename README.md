Odds & Predictions
Qualification: Arsenal 1/7, Real Madrid 6/1.
Match Odds: Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1, Arsenal 7/2.
THE Expert’s View: Arsenal are favorites to go through, but Real Madrid’s habit of scoring dramatic late winners at the Bernabéu means this tie is not decided until referees blow their whistles.
In other words: Arsenal won so vastly, they carry a three-nil aggregate advantage back across town for the return leg at the Bernabéu. Real Madrid is without many of its top players and must mount a historic comeback to reach the semifinals. Well, unbeaten, not breached by Madrid in Europe, Arsenal find themselves on the precipice of a much less familiar destination — a Champions League semifinal
